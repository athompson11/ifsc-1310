                            A general biography
                        </h2>
                        <blockquote>“History only remembers the victors. Stand with Noxus, and be remembered forever.”<br>
                            <cite>-Darius</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Darius' began life as an orphan in the harsh and impoverished city of Basilich with his brother, Draven,
                            something that would come to shape him for the rest of his life.
                            He was a born fighter and struggled to provide for himself and his brother.
                            When he became a teenager, Basilich was siezed by Cyrus, who commanded a Warhost for the Noxian empire - and
                            he was taken in by Cyrus, who took a liking to him.
                            From his teens to his adulthood, he fought alongside Cyrus with his brother Draven, and the trio would go on
                            to conquer a path from one end of the continent to the other, proving the pair as a mighty duo, and
                            elevating them within Noxian society.
                            You see, within Noxus, any person can rise to status and power, even command their own warband, irregardless
                            of who they were or where they were from - no titles were inherited, no land was bought, or sold, the mighty
                            took the place at the helm on their own.
                            Darius took this ideology and fervently worked to grow from a soldier in Cyrus' warband to commanding
                            officer and eventually to general, which he earned through taking the head of a Noxian general who had
                            ordered a retreat - and reforming broken lines to win the battle of Dalamor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it was heard that the mighty Darius has gotten his own command, he attracted recruits from far and wide
                            - and many, he turned away, only accepting the most disciplined, iron willed, and strongest of them all.
                            He - and his warband - quickly gained notoriety, and it became common for many cities to surrender at the
                            first site of his banners, even in lands far beyond Noxus.
                            After a hard fought victory against the mountain fortresses of Varju, ending in a year the resistance of a
                            people who had for decades resisted Noxian aggression - Darius was named the Hand of Noxus by the Emperor
                            himself.
                            All that knew him, and of him, knew that he did not want power or adulation - just for Noxian victory over
                            all, and to help the oppressed rise against their weak oppressors.
                            When taking a city ruled by a petty king who was well known to rule by bloodshed, he said: <q>Kings demand
                            you kneel before their heirlooms and unearned titles. Noxus wants you to stand, so that you can stand in
                            the glory shared by all.</q>

                            <dd>As a <em>Juggernaut</em> champion, Darius is a close range brawler and is best suited to ambush or direct
                                melee engagements where he can take advantage of his passive bleed-on-hit and his abilities.

                            <dd>As a close range fighter that is also tanky, Darius needs a solo lane to be able to easily farm enough
                                gold to snowball him into either a tank role or a damage role late game.

                        <p>In general, Darius tends to scale very well, whether he's built to take punishment or dish it out, and brings
                            the pain with his bleed passive.
