      <h5>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h5>
      <br>
      <p>I believe that Progressive Enhancement is a great methodology for developing front ends for websites and just as important as other development processes.</p>
      <p>It's content centric first and foremost and focuses on building layers up to produce a frontend and website that looks and behaves well across a variety of devices.</p>
      <p>It's important because it's conducive with the way that the modern web has been built and standardized standardized if practiced well, and focuses on producing high quality 'layers' that allow for maintainable websites and maximum functionality across as many devices and browsers as possible - the layers on top of the content are wholly removable without massively affecting the experience, even if the experience is best with all of them.</p>
      <p>An additional article on Progressive Enhancement is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement" id="prog-en-link"> here.</a></p>

      <h5>Segway Revision</h5>
      <br>
      <p>The only criticisms I received from the person I asked for feedback were related to visual accessibility, so I made the following changes:</p>
      <p>I created a solid, 2 pixel wide border around the image of a diagram to increase visual clarity and make it pop vs the background.</p>
      <p>I darkened the alpha of the about us background to enhance visual clarity vs the trees.</p>
      <p>I increased the font weight globally to make all text more clear and to contrast better with the background.</p>
      <p>I also changed the background color globally to help contrast with the text.</p>
      <p>I've learned quite a lot over the semester - I knew absolutely nothing about HTML or CSS when I walked in the proverbial door.</p>
      <p>What I feel like I did well was design related - I like the colors I put together and the way I did the nav bar.</p>
      <p>What I'd do over if I started over would focusing more on a single page design focused on Javascript transitions to make it feel speedier and more fluid rather than 'just' transitioning between the HTML pages as per the design document.</p>
      <p>All in all, I'm very happy with what I've learned, and I look forward to learning front-end frameworks as my career progresses as a logical step up from 'vanilla' design.</p>
